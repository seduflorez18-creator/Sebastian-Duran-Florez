# 👋 Hi, I'm Sebastián — Data Analytics (Transitioning)

Industrial Engineer transitioning into Data Analytics. I’m currently building my first technical portfolio while learning how data supports better decision-making.

I’m exploring Excel, Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn), SQL, and Data Visualization. I’m also getting familiar with GitHub for version control and documentation — still learning the interface, but motivated to keep improving and shipping projects.

I’m interested in roles related to:
- Data Analytics
- Business Intelligence
- Process Improvement
- Data-driven Operations

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I come from operational and logistics environments where I developed problem-solving, adaptability, teamwork, and communication skills. Now I’m applying those strengths to analytics and data-driven insights.

My goal is to build reliable analyses that help teams make better decisions, improve processes, and understand user or business behavior.
